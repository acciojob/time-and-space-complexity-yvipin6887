	  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	  <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that helps determine how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to run as a function of the input size.</p>
	  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input. A common example is O(n), which indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
